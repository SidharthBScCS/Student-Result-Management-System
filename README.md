# Student Result Management System

## Problem Statement
The Student Result Management System is a software solution designed to
efficiently manage student records, perform roll number-based lookups, store data using
hashing, and sort marks and roll numbers using various algorithms. This system leverages trees,
hashing, and sorting techniques to handle student data, enable efficient retrieval, and compare
the performance of different sorting algorithms. The assignment focuses on implementing these
data structures and algorithms to address real-world student result management scenarios.
